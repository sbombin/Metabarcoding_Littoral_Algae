# Metabarcoding
The current study aimed to take advantage of the recently developed technology for biotic community assessment through the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of environmental DNA (eDNA) known as the eDNA metabarcoding to evaluate littoral algal communities. 
Here, I will post all scripts that were used to process eDNA sequencing data as well as to create new algae metabarcoding reference database. Individual scripts would be organized into the complete pipeline in the near future
